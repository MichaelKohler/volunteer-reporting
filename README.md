Mozilla Volunteer Reporting
====

Goal
---

The goal is to provide a reporting platform which automatically creates reports from data sources so volunteers can show and see what they are contributing too.

Start the server
---

Requirements:
* Node 7 or higher

```
$ cd server
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Now you can reach the API through ```localhost:3000```.

If you want to watch for changes and automatically restart the server after changes, you can install node-dev and then start the watch tasks.

```
$ npm install -g node-dev
$ npm run watch
```

Start the client
